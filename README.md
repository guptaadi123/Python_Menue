# Python_Bot
In the above repo we have created python bot which can run lvm script,docker script,some of aws cli script and also it can configure yum in rhel we ahve done this because we all know in todays growing world not everypne familiar with commands they know hot to use but remembering command is big job so in that case this script will come into picture and we can use this when ever we needed

This script has been created by me and my whole arth team.
